# Client Scheduler
This project was made to be a simple tool to assist my partner's work as a public defender by helping her manage her docket. When she is appointed clients, she may receive between 15-20 individual clients. This happens while court is ongoing so agility is important. Recording each individual's information and scheduling meetings can unnecessarily time consuming so this application was created to assist her needs. 

With the application pulled up on a laptop or phone, each client input their own information, allowing my partner to attend to other important court matters in the background. Clients will saves their names, contact information and the current date into a database for future review. Once the client has submitted their information, they are then prompeted with a Calendly component so they can select an available date and time to schedule a meeting and further discuss their case.

Current Deployment: https://defendant-scheduler.onrender.com/

*As the needs of my partner's job expands, additional features will be added and this repo will be updated.*
